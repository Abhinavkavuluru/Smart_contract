# Sample Hardhat Project

🔗 Smart_contract – Ethereum Blockchain for AgriConnect

This repository contains the smart contract system and Hardhat setup used in the AgriConnect project for managing secure blockchain-based contract farming. It includes the Solidity smart contract, Hardhat environment, and scripts required to deploy and test the Ethereum-based backend.

---

## 📦 Project Structure

- `contracts/` – Contains the Solidity smart contract file `FarmerBuyerContract.sol`
- `scripts/` – Deployment scripts and utility functions for contract interaction
- `artifacts/` – Auto-generated by Hardhat (after compilation)
- `hardhat.config.js` – Configuration file for Hardhat

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS)
- Hardhat (`npm install --save-dev hardhat`)
- MetaMask browser extension (for interacting with deployed contracts)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/Abhinavkavuluru/Smart_contract.git
    cd Smart_contract

### 2. Install Dependencies

    npm install

### 3. Run Local Ethereum Node (Hardhat)

    npx hardhat node

> This will start a local blockchain on http://127.0.0.1:8545 with pre-funded accounts

### 4. Deploy the Contract

In a separate terminal:

    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

### 5. Copy the Contract Address

After deployment, copy the deployed contract address and paste it into your Flask frontend `.env` under `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

## 🔍 Contract Summary

**FarmerBuyerContract.sol** handles:

- Creating agricultural contracts between farmers and buyers
- Order acceptance and delivery confirmation
- Escrow-like logic for tracking payment and fulfillment

All transactions are stored on a local Ethereum blockchain using Hardhat.

---

## 🔐 Integration with AgriConnect

This repo works as the blockchain backbone for the full-stack [AgriConnect](https://github.com/Abhinavkavuluru/AgriConnect) application.

Make sure this local node is running before starting the Flask server.
